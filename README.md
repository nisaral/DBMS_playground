## Relational Databases

There are many ways of storing data on a computer (text files, JSON files, CSV files, spreadsheets etc.). A relational database is a data storage system with the following properties:

1. Data is stored in tables e.g., `customers`, `products`, `offices`, `employees`, etc..
2. Each table has a set of columns. Each column is used to store a specific type of data.
3. Data is stored as rows (also called records) within database tables.
4. Tables support CRUD operations on rows: Create, Read, Update and Delete
4. Table can be connected to other tables using relationship constraints (e.g. an employee works at a specific office).
5. Information can be retrieved from the database using the Structured Query Language (SQL)
6. Databases can be hosted locally (on your computer) or on the cloud, for distributed access.

Here's what a table in a relational database looks like:
